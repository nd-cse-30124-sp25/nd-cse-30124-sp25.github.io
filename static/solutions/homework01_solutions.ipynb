Understanding different search strategies and the implementation of algorithms like A* is critical for developing intelligent systems.

Our goal in this puzzle is to arrange the numbers in sorted order, left to right, top to bottom as illustrated in the above figure. As mentioned in class, A* is an \"informed\" search strategy which means we will need some kind of heuristic to solve our problem. In this solution we will use something called the \"Manhattan Distance\".\n",
