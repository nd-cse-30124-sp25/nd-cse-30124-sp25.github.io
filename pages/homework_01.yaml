    ## Task 0: A Tap on your Shoulder

    "Quack Quack Quack"

    You toss another piece of bread to the ducks, beginning to gather around you, in Central Park.
    Suddenly, you feel a tap on your shoulder. You turn around, and there is a man standing there.

    "Detective Student?" he asks, "We have a slight problem, there's been a murder."
    "No time for questions, we need to you get to the William Floyd Estate as soon as possible."

    He pushes you off and you quicky check your pockets. You have just enough money for a car to the estate!
    But wait, the congestion charges will be too expensive!

    Luckily you recall an algorithm that may be able to help you get to the estate while staying in budget!

    ## Task 1: Getting to the William Floyd Estate

    Using the A* search algorithm and the map below, find the shortest path from your current location (Central Park) to the William Floyd Estate, out on Long Island.

    ## Task 2: Solving the Murder

    ## Task 3: Catching the murderer

    Run the following notebook and answer the included questions using the method of your choosing:

    <div class="alert alert-success" markdown="1">
    [DOWNLOAD NOTEBOOK](static/homeworks/homework01.ipynb)
    </div>

    For your convenience the notebook is displayed below as HTML but you will likely
    find it easier to download the raw notebook file given above.

    <iframe src="static/homework_htmls/homework01.html" width="100%" height="800px"></iframe>

    <pre style="display: none;" id="dr-container" class="codehilite"><code id="dredd-response"></code></pre>

    To submit your answers, you will need add your `homework01.ipynb` file
    in the `homework01` folder of your **assignments** repository:

    Answer the questions in your notebook file using the method of your choice and
    once you are finished, follow the instructions below to submit your notebook.

    1. For this class, you must use a **separate [git] branch for each
    assignment**.  This means that the work for each reading and challenge must
    be done in a separate branch.  To create and checkout a new branch, you can
    do the following:

            :::bash
            $ git checkout main         # Make sure we are in master branch
            $ git pull --rebase           # Make sure we are up-to-date with github repository

            $ git checkout -b homework01   # Create homework00 branch and check it out

        Once you do the above, you should see the following output for the
        [git-branch] command:

            :::bash
            $ git branch
              main
              homework00
            * homework01

        The `*` indicates that we are currently on the `homework01` branch.

    2. Once you have your notebook filled out, you need to add, commit the file, and
    push your commits to [GitHub]:

            :::bash
            $ git add homework01.ipynb                # Add answers.json to staging area
            $ git commit -m "Homework 01: Done"    # Commit work

            $ git push -u origin homework01        # Push branch to GitHub

        <div class="alert alert-success" markdown="1">
        **Note**: You may edit and commit changes to your branch as many times
        as you wish.  Just make sure all of your work goes in the appropriate
        branch and then perform a `git push` when you are done.
        </div>

    3. When you are ready for your final submission, you need to create a
    **pull request** via the [GitHub] interface:

        - First, go to your repository's **Branches** page and then press the
        **New pull request** button for the appropriate branch:

            <div class="thumbnail">
            <img src="static/img/pr_step_1.png" class="img-responsive"/>
            </div>

        - Next, edit the **pull request** title to "Homework 01", write a
          comment if necessary and then press the "Create pull request" button.

            <div class="thumbnail">
            <img src="static/img/pr_step_2.png" class="img-responsive"/>
            </div>

    Once you have made the **pull request**, the instructor or teaching
    assistant can verify your work and provide feedback via the discussion form
    inside the **pull request**.  If necessary, you can update your submission
    by simply committing and pushing to the appropriate branch; the **pull
    request** will automatically be updated to match your latest work.

    When all work is graded, the grader will merge your branch and close the
    **pull request**.

    <div class="alert alert-danger" markdown="1">
    **Note**: Please **do not merge** your own **pull request**.  This makes it
    more difficult for the graders to keep track of what needs to be graded.
    </div>

    <div class="alert alert-success" markdown="1">

    #### <i class="fa fa-thumbs-up"></i> Qualitative Feedback

    The purpose of this workflow is to provide you with better feedback.
    Instead of simply determining if your work is correct, the instructor will
    attempt to provide you with more **qualitative feedback** such as whether
    or not you used good programming practices or if your code could be
    improved or organized better.

    The hope is that this will help you grow as programmers and develop some
    **taste** :).
