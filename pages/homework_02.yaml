    <div class="alert alert-success" markdown="1">
    [DOWNLOAD NOTEBOOK](static/homeworks/homework02.ipynb)
    </div>

    <pre style="display: none;" id="dr-container" class="codehilite"><code id="dredd-response"></code></pre>

    To submit your answers, you will need add your `homework02.ipynb` file
